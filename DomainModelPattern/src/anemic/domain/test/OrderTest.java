	 * model is placed outside that object in classes mostly named "Service",
	 * "Helper", "Util", "Manager" etc.
	 * <p>
	 * <blockquote> The problem with an anemic model is that a client must know
	 * in which state the object it uses is and which service methods it has to
	 * call if it changes the state of an anemic model to keep the object in a
	 * legal state. </blockquote>
